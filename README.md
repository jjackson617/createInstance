***WORK IN PROGRESS*** 

Will run as is, but continually adding more and making tidy to make it look prettier.


createInstance creates an instance on AWS ec2.

Script will prompt for user input for ami, instance type, subnet, sshkey name, and tag unless -p is specified. 

If "-p" is called as a commandline flag it will only prompt for ami.
